# **PROJECT ERGON**

Project Ergon aims at minimizing ergonomic risks of construction worker using smartphone and machine learning models.

## **What is ergonomics?**

- Ergonomics means the science of **designing a job to fit the workers’ physical capabilities**, rather than imposing the job on workers’ body.

## **What is musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)?**

- MSDs are a group of disorders or **injuries in a person's inner body parts** (e.g. muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, cartilages, and spinal discs).
- Construction jobs are among the most **ergonomically hazardous** occupations which involve activities such as manual handling, heavy lifting, body twisting, and frequently working in awkward positions, all being potential causes of MSDs.

## **What does project Ergon deal with?**

### **1. Awkward posture**

If a person is not in his/her natural posture. Performing activity in an awkward posture repetitively and/or for a long time can cause MSDs.

**Demo:** ([Watch the full video](https://youtu.be/2bdmS0U2x-Q))

**Go to the '[awkward-posture](/awkward-posture)' folder for more details.**

### **2. Overexertion**

If a person applies too much force to perform an activty. Performing overexerted activity for a long time and/or very frequently can cause MSDs.
